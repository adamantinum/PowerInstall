A simple Arch Linux install script I've written to appoach PowerShell - and in general with shell scripting - then so much can be improved. 
It's intended as a _divertissement_, because of it customization is extremely limited. Maybe in future I'll go back to that, expanding capabilities.
At the moment the script is able to install Arch Linux with GNOME as Desktop Environment on the entire disk and in UEFI mode, without any other customization.
